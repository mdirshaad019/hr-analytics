logistic regression

hr-analytics is a major issue of any organisation.Organizations
spend huge amount of time and money to hire and nurture their employees. It
is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources.
So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it
will allow them to identify the attrition risks and help understand and provide
necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to
minimize the impact to the organization.
